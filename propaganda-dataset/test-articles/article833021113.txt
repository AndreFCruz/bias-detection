Roger Stone associate Jerome Corsi celebrates end of Mueller probe after REFUSING to sign plea deal

Roger Stone associate Jerome Corsi has said that the end of special counsel Robert Mueller' investigation is a personal vindication, after he refused to take a plea deal under threat of prosecution.
With a senior Justice Department official saying that Mueller's final report submitted on Friday does not recommend further indictments, author and conspiracy theorist Corsi appears to be off the hook.
'I feel vindicated.
They offered me a plea deal which I thought was fraudulent,' Corsi said in a statement to Fox News.
In November, Corsi said he had refused to plead guilty to one count of perjury because he did not believe that he had committed any crime.

'I did not knowingly and willfully give them information I knew was false,' Corsi said on Friday.
'The fact is I wasn't going to lie to keep myself out of prison.
I did nothing wrong and it is clear I did nothing wrong or they would have prosecuted me.'
Corsi celebrated the news in a series of triumphant tweets, writing: 'It's over but it has been the worst seven months of my life.
MUELLER IS DONE.
I am in the clear.'
'I want to thank all of you who have prayed for me and my family,' he added, attributing his legal outcome to the power of prayer.
Corsi came under scrutiny by Mueller for his communications with Stone, a Trump campaign advisor, about WikiLeaks publishing stolen emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign.

Court documents indicate that Stone sought to use him as an intermediary to communicate with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during the election.
Stone was arrested in January in a pre-dawn raid on his home in Florida, and is charged with one count of obstruction of an official proceeding, five counts of false statements, and one count of witness tampering.
He is currently free on bond and has pleaded not guilty on all counts.
Mueller's probe ended without any Americans being charged with conspiring with the Russian government to tamper with the 2016 election, the central allegation of the nearly two-year investigation.
