Cable viewers digest Mueller news through Hannity, Maddow

For Sean Hannity, the 'witch hunt' was finally over.
Rachel Maddow considered it the start of something.
The diametrically opposed opinion hosts, who vie for the distinction of the most popular in cable news, were the windows through which many Americans digested Friday's news that special counsel Robert Mueller had concluded a nearly two-year investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 election.
While his report, or even a summary, has not been released, television news still had hours to fill talking about it.
Fox News Channel's Hannity, a close Trump ally, focused on reports there will be no additional indictments stemming from Mueller's probe.

'The left's favorite conspiracy theory is now dead,' Hannity said.
'It is buried, and there was no collusion, no conspiracy, no obstruction.
The witch hunt is over and there will be no further charges.'
He lamented that lives were ruined by the investigation and said that people who have been prosecuted or convicted had committed 'process crimes,' or crimes such as lying to investigators that stem from the very existence of the investigation.
The accusations against Trump were 'what we always said, a hoax, a lie conceived by hate.'
Hannity's Fox colleague Tucker Carlson stressed that the investigation had ended with no charges related to 'collusion' between President Donald Trump's campaign and the Russian government, the purported impetus for the probe.
'This investigation was always, from day one about collusion with Russia, about betraying this country.
They told us that for years,' Carlson said.
Carlson played a highlight reel of Democrats and pundits on other channels previously predicting imminent indictments of Trump and his family members.
None were indicted and Mueller reportedly doesn't recommend any further prosecutions.
'This has been a disaster.
How can we let the people who are responsible for it continue as if it never happened?'
he said, calling for the resignation of top Democrats who have pushed the collusion narrative.

While Carlson suggested it was a night Americans 'should be celebrating the great news' that no crime was apparently found regarding collusion, Hannity said citizens should be outraged by the amount of time and money spent on the case.
He promised a reckoning in the coming weeks of politicians and media figures he claimed were guilty of a rush to judgment, and his first target was U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Investigations Committee.
'Schifty Schiff' read the words onscreen behind him.
'What is Maddow and all the other MSNBC conspiracy theorists, what are they going to ever do now?'
he said.
As he talked, Maddow was doing the same.
Unlike most evenings, when the two figures work in studios across Manhattan's Sixth Avenue from each other, Maddow had rushed to a studio in Tennessee where she had spent the day trout fishing.
'Finally, it happened,' she said.
'In terms of what that means and what Mueller has found, we know only the smallest little bits.
This is the start of something, not the end of something.'
In meticulous fashion, she detailed how the news that Mueller's investigation had concluded was reported and what a letter by Attorney General William Barr meant about what will be released to the public.
Rachel Maddow waited until 16 minutes into her program to discuss the reports that there will be no new indictments stemming from the probe
Democrats in Congress have already demanded the full report be released and that they see background materials; Maddow read a letter by Schiff about that on the air.
'Right now we mostly have just a ton of questions, as to what Mueller's report says, who gets to see it, who gets to decide who gets to see it and when,' she said.
It wasn't until 16 minutes into her program that she discussed the reports that there will be no new indictments stemming from the probe.
Many Fox News Channel guests, not just Hannity, focused on that detail on Friday evening.
Former Trump aide Corey Lewandowski called it 'a very clear signal that this entire hoax is over.'
Still, some Fox personalities, including Chris Wallace and Harris Faulkner, had to caution guests that Mueller's report hadn't been seen yet.
'To say that somehow this clears the president seems like the height of rushing to judgment,' Wallace said.
He dismissed the idea that those prosecuted had been charged with process crimes, saying they were very serious.
Meanwhile, on CNN, analyst and frequent Trump critic Jeffrey Toobin had an answer to colleagues who warned Trump and his supporters against prematurely celebrating.
While he isn't necessarily in the clear, the fact that the president's sons or son-in-law Jared Kushner were not indicted 'is unambiguously good news for him,' Toobin said.
