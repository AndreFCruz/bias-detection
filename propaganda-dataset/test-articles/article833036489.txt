Bill Maher says he doesn't need Mueller report to know Trump is a traitor 'because he has a TV'

Bill Maher has said he doesn't need the Robert Mueller report to know President Donald Trump is a traitor 'because he has a TV'.
Speaking on his Friday night show the Real Time host said: 'I must say, I don't think it looks good.
No further indictments, which means not Don Jr., even after the "I love it" memo, really?
Not Jared, not Manafort or Stone for working with the Russians.
'Did the Democrats put too must trust in the Mueller report?
Because I don't need the Mueller report to know he's a traitor.
I have a TV.'
Maher was joined by a panel of Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell, GOP pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson and former Deputy Assistant Secretary for Defense for Russia Evelyn Farkas.
After labeling Trump a traitor the audience the clapped in approval.
Swalwell agreed, saying 'yes, if you have a TV or a Twitter account you've already seen obstruction of justice'.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller has not recommended any new criminal indictments as he wraps up his Russia probe.
Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, said he and the president's other lawyers 'are confident that there is no finding of collusion by the president'
Swalwell said: 'And people are on their way to jail, have gone to jail, there's probably a farming out of other investigations, but yes, if you have a TV or a Twitter account you've already seen obstruction of justice.
'But here's what's important is that the public sees the report contemporaneously with the president.
He should not be allowed to edit, he should not be allowed to restrict or sanitize, and Mueller has to come before Congress and tell us its veracity.'
He said they would subpoena Mueller to testify before Congress to make that happen.
Anderson said she was 'glad' that the Mueller report was filed, suggesting that the president had helped to drive down the public's opinion of the special counsel's investigation.
Maher added: 'He knows how to do that - to hammer the same thing every day, month after month after month.
''Mueller's dirty, I'm clean!"
Can you imagine getting people to believe that?'
Mueller has not recommended any new criminal indictments as he wraps up his Russia probe.
He delivered a long-awaited report Friday to Attorney General Bill Barr, opening up the possibility that key members of Congress could know its bottom line by the end of the weekend.
President Donald Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, said he and the president's other lawyers 'are confident that there is no finding of collusion by the president.'
