Donald Trump and the First Lady of the United States didn't appear to be fazed after Robert Mueller handed over his report on the president's Russia connections Friday.
POTUS and Melania Trump were grinning from ear-to-ear as they posed for a photo opportunity with Caribbean leaders in Florida as the world waited for a reaction to the probe being officially complete.
Standing on the steps of Trump's beloved vacation spot, spectators waited for some indication the Special Counsel news may have stirred them.

While her husband is under intense scrutiny, all eyes were on Melania during the photo call.
Melania wore a linen silk dress from UK brand LK Bennett featuring distracting bold orange, white and black Aztec-inspired prints.
The cinched-in-at-the-waist 'Andrea' round-neck occasion dress is currently on sale for $282.50, down from $565.
Melania paired the midi-length half price frock with Christian Louboutin heels.
The First Lady had a breezy attitude as she took to social media to speak about her day with Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness, Haiti President Jovenel Moise, Saint Lucia's Prime Minister Allen Michael Chastanet, Dominican Republic President Danilo Medina, and Bahamas Prime Minister Hubert Minnis.
'Enjoyed hosting the leaders & their delegations,' she posted on Twitter about the day at West Palm Beach.

Minnis, Prime Minister of the Bahamas
Earlier Trump had shared a video on Twitter from inside his meeting.
Making no mention of the Mueller report, he posted: 'Today in Florida, @FLOTUS and I were honored to welcome and meet with leaders from the Bahamas, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, and Saint Lucia!'
He arrived on Air Force One at the Palm Beach International Airport waving to supporters.
Late on Friday Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani told Fox News: 'This marks the end of the Russia investigation.
We await a disclosure of the facts.
We are confident that there is no finding of collusion by the president and this underscores what the president has been saying from the beginning - that he did nothing wrong.'

Barr said in a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.; Ranking Member Doug Collins, R-Ga.; Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.; and Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., that he 'may be in a position to advise you of the Special Counsel's principal conclusions as soon as this weekend'.
'Separately, I intend to consult with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Special Counsel Mueller to determine what other information from the report can be released to Congress and the public consistent with law, including the Special Counsel regulations, and the Department's long-standing practices and policies,' he added Friday.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a joint statement: 'It is imperative for Mr. Barr to make the full report public and provide its underlying documentation and findings to Congress.
'Attorney General Barr must not give President Trump, his lawyers or his staff any 'sneak preview' of Special Counsel Mueller's findings or evidence, and the White House must not be allowed to interfere in decisions about what parts of those findings or evidence are made public.'
