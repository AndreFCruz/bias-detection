It's unclear how much of the report the public will be able to see.
Democratic lawmakers are calling on the full release of the report to the public.
"Now that Special Counsel Mueller has submitted his report to the Attorney General, it is imperative for Mr. Barr to make the full report public and provide its underlying documentation and findings to Congress," Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuch Schumer, said in a joint statement.
"Attorney General Barr must not give President Trump, his lawyers or his staff any 'sneak preview' of Special Counsel Mueller's findings or evidence, and the White House must not be allowed to interfere in decisions about what parts of those findings or evidence are made public.
"The Special Counsel's investigation focused on questions that go to the integrity of our democracy itself: whether foreign powers corruptly interfered in our elections, and whether unlawful means were used to hinder that investigation.
The American people have a right to the truth.
The watchword is transparency."
