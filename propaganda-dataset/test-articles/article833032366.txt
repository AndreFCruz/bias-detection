Mueller Report On President Trump Sent To Attorney General

WASHINGTON, D.C. — The highly anticipated Mueller Report on the findings of Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation was delivered to Attorney General William Barr on Friday, Barr told lawmakers in a letter.
In the letter, Barr told lawmakers that he was reviewing the report and that he anticipates telling Congress about the conclusion in the report as soon as this weekend.
It's unclear how much of the report the public will be able to see and Barr said in his Friday letter that he would consult with Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to determine what information can be released to the public and Congress consistent with the law, the Special Counsel regulations and the DOJ's practices and policies.
President Donald Trump on Friday called the investigation a "witch hunt" and a "hoax."
"So we'll see what happens," Trump told reporters on Friday.
"I know that the Attorney General, highly respected, ultimately will make a decision."
In a statement, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the next steps are up to Barr and the administration looks forward to the process taking its course.
"The White House has not received or been briefed on the Special Counsel's report," Sanders said.
The delivery of the report to the Department of Justice means that the nearly two-year inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether there was any collusion between members of the Trump campaign and Russian operatives has come to a close.
Mueller's inquiry has led to a number of indictments and guilty pleas, including from former National Security Advisor Mike Flynn and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.

A.G. Barr has confirmed the completion of the Special Counsel investigation.
We look forward to getting the full Mueller report and related materials.
Transparency and the public interest demand nothing less.
The need for public faith in the rule of law must be the priority.
